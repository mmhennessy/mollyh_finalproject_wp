		<p>Building Bridges was founded in 2014. It works to build communication between the various groups in our society. The various groups may nuclide but are not limited to ethnic minorities and people with disabilities. Building Bridges works to resolve these issues in a variety of ways. Some of these include educating the community about stereotypes, hosting workshops and hosting events. We are firm believers that educating society is an important step in breaking down stereotypes and opening communication in the community.  </p>
